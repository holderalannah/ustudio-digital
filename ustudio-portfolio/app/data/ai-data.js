        projectBriefing: "We were the test studio to adapt global Hellmann's assets for the Canadian market. The assets were built in Pencil by the global team with the intention that elements (packshots, copy, backgrounds, etc) could be easily swapped out, streamlining the process for localizing global assets moving forward​",
        projectSolution: "In addition to updating packshots to CAN packs and implementing FR copy translations, we generated 3 net new backgrounds for the static outputs, as well as 2 net new videos and FR voiceovers for the animated assets. There were a few hurdles faced during the adaption process that could be improved on future projects (ie. how the assets were initially setup in Pencil and limitations in what we could edit within the platform vs using AE and bringing back into Pencil), but overall the project was a successful first pass at global adaption on a large scale in Pencil.",
