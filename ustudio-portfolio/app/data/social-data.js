Converting engagement into sales was crucial to secure the ongoing restocking of OLLY products at Costco.",

The team supported the creation of \"Shot on iPhone\" content to connect with the audience in an authentic way, avoiding an overly promotional feel, while leveraging social media trends to spotlight the product. From crafting product teasers, running social giveaways and coordinating PR gifting to developing engaging content,  U-Studio ensured brand campaigns were aligned with a social-first strategy.",
